                    <p>This set was inspired by the band, Roselia. Based on the series BanG Dream! A media franchise that has an anime, concerts, music and a mobile rhythm game. Roselia is known for their gothic inspired designs, their colorful characters and their powerful music. The color scheme is based on the logo's gradient and the band's official color. The colors have been matched physically with a RAL book with official merch. </p>
